- **Access to electricity (% of population)**: The percentage of population with access to electricity.
- **Access to clean fuels for cooking (% of population)**: The percentage of the population with primary reliance on clean fuels.
- **Renewable-electricity-generating-capacity-per-capita**: Installed Renewable energy capacity per person
- **Financial flows to developing countries (US $)**: Aid and assistance from developed countries for clean energy projects.
- **Renewable energy share in total final energy consumption (%)**: Percentage of renewable energy in final energy consumption.
- **Electricity from fossil fuels (TWh)**: Electricity generated from fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) in terawatt-hours.
- **Electricity from nuclear (TWh)**: Electricity generated from nuclear power in terawatt-hours.
- **Electricity from renewables (TWh)**: Electricity generated from renewable sources (hydro, solar, wind, etc.) in terawatt-hours.
- **Low-carbon electricity (% electricity)**: Percentage of electricity from low-carbon sources (nuclear and renewables).
- **Primary energy consumption per capita (kWh/person)**: Energy consumption per person in kilowatt-hours.
- **Energy intensity level of primary energy (MJ/$2011 PPP GDP)**: Energy use per unit of GDP at purchasing power parity.
- **Value_co2_emissions (metric tons per capita)**: Carbon dioxide emissions per person in metric tons.
- **Renewables (% equivalent primary energy)**: Equivalent primary energy that is derived from renewable sources.
- **GDP growth (annual %)**: Annual GDP growth rate based on constant local currency.
- **GDP per capita**: Gross domestic product per person.
- **Density (P/Km2)**: Population density in persons per square kilometer.
- **Land Area (Km2)**: Total land area in square kilometers.
- **Latitude**: Latitude of the country's centroid in decimal degrees.
- **Longitude**: Longitude of the country's centroid in decimal degrees.
