## BRFSS Dataset
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nationâ€™s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. 

## Preprocessing of BRFSS Dataset
I preprocessed and cleaned the BRFSS Dataset. From 304 unique variables, I hand-picked 19 variables that relates to lifestyle factors of a person that can be contributed to being at risk with any form of Cardiovascular Diseases.
